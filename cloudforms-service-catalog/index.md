# Build a service catalog with CloudForms

User self-service is seen as one of the defining capabilities of cloud computing. Red Hat CloudForms provides a self-service portal and catalog to deploy IT services over a variety of virtualization and cloud providers. In this lab you will get an introduction to CloudForms self-service followed by hands-on examples. You will start by creating a service catalog item to deploy a VM and then move on to more advanced topics like orchestration templates (Azure ARM or AWS CloudFormation) as services.
